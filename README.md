# ShopifyChallenge

This repository is for the Shopify backend engineering internship position.

To run the demo, please download the Project1.exe and run it. I chose the option of the undeletion of files and comment history.

The trial folder is my first attempt at the problem, where I mainly did the backend part of the problem with no front end. However, I later realized that I would need more of a GUI than a command prompt, so I switched to another IDE.
